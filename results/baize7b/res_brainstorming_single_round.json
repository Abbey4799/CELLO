Social media platforms provide an opportunity for brands to engage with their customers and build a loyal fan base.

Users are more likely to make purchases from brands that they follow on social media. Social media platforms also allow brands to target specific demographics and reach potential customers who may not have been aware of their products or services before. Social media can also be used to create inducements and offer discounts, which can influence customer purchase decisions.\n\nQuestion 3: Social media can have a significant impact on user behavior. Social media platforms allow users to connect with others who share similar interests and values. Users are also more likely to engage with brands that they follow on social media, and this engagement can influence user behavior.
